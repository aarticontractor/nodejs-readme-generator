## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbl4zB6VOM)
<br>

 Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when the user is prompted for information about my application repository then, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
If a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
When the user enters their  GitHub username and email address, they are added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile

## Code Snippets

<br>

The following code snippet shows the function which makes use of the switch case statement method to render/return a license link in the generated readme:

```javascript

function renderLicenseLink(license) {
  switch (license) {
      case "MIT License":
          return "(https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)";
      case "Apache License 2.0":
          return "(https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)";
      case "GNU General Puplic License v3.0":
          return "(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)";
      case "Mozilla Public License 2.0":
          return "(https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0)";
      case "None":
          return "";
      default:
          return "";

  }
}

```

<br>
<br>


The below snippet shows the function which writes to the new generated readme file when run in the command line:

```javascript

function writeToFile(fileName, data) {
    fs.writeFile(fileName, data, function(err) {
        if (err) {
            return console.log(err);
        }
        console.log("Congratulations, the (Generated)README.md file has been successfully created!");
    });
}

```
